                    description: Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty
                      means match all taint effects. When specified, allowed values

                      Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists
                      is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can tolerate
                      all taints of a particular category.

                      field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default, it is not
                      set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict).
                      Zero and negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately)
                      by the system.

                      just a regular string.
